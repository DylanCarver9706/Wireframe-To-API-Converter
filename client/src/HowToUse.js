          <h2>How to Use Wireframe to API Converter</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Wireframe to API Converter is a user-friendly web application that
            allows you to convert backend database wireframes into RESTful API
            structures effortlessly and kick-start your next project ASAP.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Wireframe to API Converter is intended to provide RESTful API
            endpoints for app development with basic CRUD methods tailored to
            your database to get you started faster. The generated API
            structures are made from Ruby on Rails methods and can be used as a
            starting point for your backend development. Please note that the
            database used is MySQL. Follow the steps below to effectively use
            the application.
          </p>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <br />
        <div className="instruction">
          <strong>Start Your Wireframe:</strong> Go to "Wireframe Maker" at the
          top to start creating the wireframe for your backend database.
        </div>
        <div className="instruction">
          <strong>Name Your Database:</strong> At the top there will be a header
          that says 'Database Name'. This will be the name of your database and
          ultimately your ruby project when you generate the tables into an APi.{" "}
          {/* <strong>
            For database naming conventions, please do no have any spaces,
            capital letters, or special characters
          </strong>{" "} */}
          {/* when naming the database. This will prevent the API from being
          generated later. Some examples or database names are
          'restaurant-database' or 'my-new-ruby-api' */}
        </div>
        <div className="instruction">
          <strong>Create Your Endpoints/Tables:</strong> In the tables on the app, you will see
          'http://localhost:3000/Table Title'. In the input field, enter the
          name of the table. These will be the names of your endpoints when the API is created.
          {/* <strong>Be sure not to pluralize the table names </strong>
          as the Ruby methods will take care of that and it can cause issues for
          join tables later. */}
        </div>
        <div className="instruction">
          <strong>Add Attributes:</strong> The attributes
          are the columns for your database table. Do not pluralize these names.
          It won't affect anything, it just looks wrong. There is no need to
          specify "id" as an attribute as this is taken care of with Ruby
          methods, but be sure to add your ids into your join table to follow
          Ruby conventions.
        </div>
        <div className="instruction">
          <strong>Establish Relationships:</strong> To create
          relationships/associations between tables, select the appropriate
          relationship type from the dropdown and choose the related table. For
          "has_many_through" relationships, specify the through table as well.
          Click on the "Add Relationship" button to add the relationship to the
          table. Follow this guide to find the appropriate relationship for your
          table:&nbsp;

          <strong>Generate API:</strong> Once you've defined the attributes and
          relationships of your database, click on the "Generate API" button in
          the header bar. The application will create an API based on the
          wireframe and download a custom script to get it running.

        <div className="instruction">
          <strong>Run the Script:</strong> Now you can run the Python script

            <strong>
              Q: What happens if I close the script window while the port is
              running?
            </strong>
            <p>
              A: No worries! If you close the script window while the port is
              running, you can easily restart the API. Head to the location
              where saved the download to and find your ruby project folder,
              navigate to the project directory, and navigate to the /app
              sub-directory. In your terminal for that directory, run 'rails s'
              to start the API on the same port again.

            <p>
              A: Great question! Currently, the app is focused on providing
              features specifically for Ruby on Rails. However, our long-term
              vision includes expanding support for other languages and
              frameworks in the future.

              Q: Can I customize the generated API code after downloading it?
            </strong>
            <p>
              A: Absolutely! You have full control over the downloaded API code.
              After generating the API, you can modify and extend it according
              to your specific project requirements. Feel free to add additional
              functionalities, validations, or endpoints as needed.

              Q: What if I encounter errors while running the custom Python

            </strong>
            <p>
              A: If you encounter any issues or errors while running the custom
              Python script, first double-check the installation of required
              dependencies like Ruby. If you are prompted to install the latest
              version of Ruby, you will have to restart the script to create
              your API. Also, ensure that you follow proper naming conventions
              for Ruby on Rails applications as this could cause the script to
              fail. If you still face problems, you can reach out to the
              application's support team by going to the "About the Author" tab
              at the top.

            </strong>
            <p>
              A: Currently, the Wireframe to API Converter supports MySQL
              databases, and it does not provide the option to switch to other
              database types in the GUI. However, if you need to use a different
              database type like PostgreSQL, you may need to manually modify the
              generated API code after downloading to change the database type.

            <p>
              A: For complex relationships like many-to-many, you can use the

              A: The Wireframe to API Converter is designed to provide a

              A: Absolutely! You can share the generated API code with your team
              members or clients. Simply provide them with the downloaded files,
              and they can set up the API on their local machines or server
              environments. Be sure to include any necessary setup instructions
